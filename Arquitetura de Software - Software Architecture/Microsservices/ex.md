# Microservices Architecture for Management System

## Services

1. **User Service**
   - Handles user authentication and authorization.
   - Manages user profiles and preferences.

2. **Inventory Service**
   - Manages product inventory.
   - Handles stock levels, product details, and inventory updates.

3. **Order Service**
   - Processes customer orders.
   - Handles order creation, updates, and status tracking.

4. **Billing Service**
   - Manages billing and invoicing.
   - Handles payment processing and transaction records.

5. **Notification Service**
   - Sends notifications via email, SMS, or push messages.
   - Handles communication templates and delivery status.

6. **Reporting Service**
   - Aggregates data from other services.
   - Provides analytics and generates reports.

## Communication

- **API Gateway**
  - Acts as a single entry point for clients.
  - Routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
  
- **Service Discovery**
  - Keeps track of available services and their locations.
  - Enables dynamic routing and scaling.

- **Message Broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ)**
  - Facilitates asynchronous communication between services.
  - Useful for events like order placed, payment completed, etc.

## Data Management

- Each microservice has its own database to ensure loose coupling.
- Use of different database technologies as per service requirements (e.g., SQL for transactions, NoSQL for flexible schemas).

## Deployment

- Containerization using Docker.
- Orchestration using Kubernetes for scaling and management.
- CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

## Monitoring and Logging

- Centralized logging using tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
- Monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana for real-time metrics.
